#### I. The project was based on a fixed layout:
 - The page was set to be displayed with normal display on small desktop devices (1366px-1700px) and static display for bigger devices.
 - For mobile and tablet displays the page loads in a full screen size saving its original dimensions at a 1024px width.
 - The layout is very close to the original but is missing some minor details such as responsiveness, spacing, font types, and JavaScript effects.  

#### II. The layout was built with HTML and CSS,  focusing on a static layout making use of:
 - Grid elements
 - Flexboxes
 - positioning
 - SVG images

#### III. The main areas of the project can be divided as follows:

  ###### &nbsp; The header
  It was created to remain fixed on the top of the page containing the standard icons for navigations purposes.

  ###### &nbsp; The media icons
  It contains the main icons for sharing the article.

  ###### &nbsp; The main content
  It comprises the main layout to display the article content (text, figures, and videos).


  ###### &nbsp; The featured section
  It has the pictures and text featuring related articles.

  ###### &nbsp; The footer
  It contains the links to other sections and articles, media links, and the copyright notice.

  ###### &nbsp; The sticky footer
  It contains a link to important announcements.
